* Each folder in this Repo has a main.py file, Images folder, Results folder and a .pdf report describing the Python program. 
* Each folder represents an individual program and has been appropriately named to identify its application. 
* Note that all programs have been written using Python and Numpy (without OpenCV or other CV libraries - with the exception of reading or writing Images).
